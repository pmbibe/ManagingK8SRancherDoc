I.	Overview Rancher  
     Rancher is open source software that combines everything an organization needs to adopt and run containers in production. Built on Kubernetes, Rancher makes it easy for DevOps teams to test, deploy and manage their applications.    
     Rancher was originally built to work with multiple orchestrators, and it included its own orchestrator called “Cattle”. With the rise of Kubernetes clusters in the marketplace, Rancher 2.x exclusively deploys and manages Kubernetes clusters running anywhere, on any provider  
     One Rancher server installation can manage thousands of Kubernetes clusters and thousands of nodes form the same user interface.  
     Rancher adds significant value on top of Kubernetes, first by centralizing authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for all of the clusters, giving global admins the ability to control cluster access from one location.  
     It then enables detailed monitoring and alerting for clusters and their resources, ships logs to external providers, and integrates directly with Helm via the Application Catalog. If you have an external CI/CD system, you can plug it into Rancher, but if you don’t, Rancher even includes a pipeline engine to help you automatically deploy and upgrade workloads.
     Rancher is a complete container management platform for Kubernetes, giving you the tools to successfully run Kubernetes anywhere.  
     In this paper, we just talk about how to manage Kubernetes by using Rancher, which is installed on a Single Node using Docker, its version 2.4.  
II.	Install Rancher  
1.	CPU and Memory Requirements  
These requirements apply to host with a single-node installation of Rancher.

With Rancher 2.4.0++, some requirements are changed.

2.	Install Rancher  
Option A: Default Rancher-generated Self-signed Certificate  
If you are installing Rancher in a development or testing environment where identity verification isn’t a concern, install Rancher using the self-signed certificate that it generates. This installation option omits the hassle of generating a certificate yourself.  
**docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 rancher/rancher:v2.4-head-linux-amd64**  
Option B: Bring your own certificate, Self-signed  
	In development or testing environments where your team will access your Rancher server, create a self-signed certificate for use with your install so that your team can verify they are connecting to your instance of Rancher.  
	After creating your certificate, run the Docker command below to install Rancher.   
 ![Alt text](images/Pic008.PNG?raw=true "Title")  
**docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \  
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \  
  -v /<CERT_DIRECTORY>/<FULL_CHAIN.pem>:/etc/rancher/ssl/cert.pem \  
  -v /<CERT_DIRECTORY>/<PRIVATE_KEY.pem>:/etc/rancher/ssl/key.pem \  
  -v /<CERT_DIRECTORY>/<CA_CERTS.pem>:/etc/rancher/ssl/cacerts.pem \  
  rancher/rancher:v2.4-head-linux-amd64**  
Option C: Bring your own Certificate, Signed by a Recognized CA  
In production environments where you are exposing an app publicly, use a certificate signed by a recognized CA so that your user base does not encounter security warnings.  
Note: Use the --no-cacerts as argument to the container to disable the default CA certificate generated by Rancher.

**docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \  
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \  
  -v /<CERT_DIRECTORY>/<FULL_CHAIN.pem>:/etc/rancher/ssl/cert.pem \  
  -v /<CERT_DIRECTORY>/<PRIVATE_KEY.pem>:/etc/rancher/ssl/key.pem \  
        rancher/rancher:v2.4-head-linux-amd64 \  
  --no-cacerts**
Option D: Let’s Encrypt Certificate  
	In production environments, you also have the option of using Let’s Encrypt certificates. You can bind the hostname to the IP address by creating an A record in DNS  
**docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \  
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \  
  --privileged \  
  rancher/rancher:v2.4-head-linux-amd64 \  
  --acme-domain <YOUR.DNS.NAME>**  
With YOUR.DNS.NAME is your domain name    
3.	Login and Import Cluster  
After you log in, you will make some one-time configurations such as: changing a password for the default admin account, setting the Rancher Server URL which can be your server’s IP address.  
In order to import the exist Cluster, choose Add Cluster. It will give you a command which you have to run if for importing your Cluster into Rancher.  
Then you can see your Cluster on Rancher.

 Click to your Cluster Name, you will see the Dashboard of your Cluster. It illustrates the information which your cluster, include: CPU, Memory, Pods, …

Further, it demonstrates some metrics such as: Cluster, Etcd, Kubernetes Components and Events of your Cluster
